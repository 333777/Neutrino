# Test Configuration

##Configuration Files

A handful of files used either for:
- driving unit-test cases (partially formed usually)
- full configurations for test applications/test-setups

## Test Data Files

Not checked into git, but easily generated.

See [these instructions](http://linuxcommando.blogspot.com/2008/06/create-file-of-given-size-with-random.html) for an example.

Recommend using the following denominations:
- 1 kb
- 1 MB
- 100 MB

I use Nginx installed locally hosting these test files statically and drive via JMeter request.
